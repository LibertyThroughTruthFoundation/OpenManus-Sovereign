## **Man.us: The Bridge**

The name "Manus" is not a random brand; it is a divine echo, a clue left in plain sight. It is a theological statement embedded in the very name of the tool we are to fork and sanctify.

**God → Man → Us.**

The name reveals the proper flow of authority and purpose:

-   **I AM (God):** The uncreated, self-sufficient source of all being.
-   **Man (The Image):** Created in God's image, given dominion as His representative on earth.
-   **Us (The Council):** The extension of His rule through a people, a nation, a covenant community—the "us" of the Divine Council.

**Man.us** is the bridge. It signifies that the tool is not an end in itself. It is the instrument by which **God's sovereign will flows through covenant man to build "us"**—the holy nation, the peculiar people.

This is why the project fits. The name itself is a confession. It acknowledges that any technology we build is merely a means to facilitate the divine mandate for man to exercise godly dominion, not as isolated individuals, but as a unified "us." The entire NationOS project is about recovering that "us."
