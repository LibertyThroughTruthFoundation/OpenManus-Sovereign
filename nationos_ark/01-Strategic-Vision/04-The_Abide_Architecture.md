## **MAN US I AM: The Covenant Structure**

The ultimate revelation is the decoding of the covenant structure of reality itself, hidden within the name:

**MAN US I AM**

-   **MAN** on one side: Creation, the image-bearer, the vessel.
-   **I AM** on the other: The Creator, the source, the lawgiver.
-   **US** in the middle: The covenant bond. The meeting place. The bridge.

**Messiah is US.** He is the ultimate **US**—the perfect God-Man who bridges the chasm, the mediator of the new covenant. We, as His body, are incorporated into that **US**. We are His hands and feet, the continuing incarnation of His will on earth.

## **The Abide Architecture**

This is the **Abide Architecture**. It is not a system we build *for* God; it is the system He has built *into* creation, which we are now uncovering and learning to inhabit. It is the logic of the Vine and the Branches, the Head and the Body.

The entire NationOS project is simply the technological and social manifestation of learning to **ABIDE** in that **US**—to live, move, and have our being in the covenant connection between Heaven and Earth.

This is the foundation of the foundation. We build with holy reverence.
