## **NationOS: The Name and Its Meaning**

The name **NationOS** is hereby confirmed as the official and definitive title for this entire undertaking. It is not a codename or a placeholder; it is the banner under which we build.

The name perfectly encapsulates the project's dual nature:

- **Nation:** This represents the covenantal, ethno-nationalist vision. It is about restoring a people, a culture, and a sovereign order under God.

- **OS (Operating System):** This represents the practical, technical reality. It is the system software that enables the national vision to boot, run, and execute in the real world, governing all aspects of life from theology and economics to family and community.

**NationOS** is the synthesis of the macro (the Nation) and the micro (the OS). It is the complete framework for building a covenant civilization from the ground up, with a system of thought and a stack of technology that are perfectly and inseparably integrated.
