**Title:** NationOS Theological Foundation: A Covenant Framework for Sovereign Building
**Author:** Bryan Pavlovic | Liberty Through Truth Foundation
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Canonical

#### **1. Preamble: The Rejection of Syncretism**
This framework operates from a position of theological total war against modern syncretism. It rejects the "Judeo-Christian" heresy, secular humanism, gnostic spiritualism, and egalitarian myths. Truth is not a consensus; it is a revelation from the God of Scripture, delivered to His people for the purpose of building a covenant civilization.

#### **2. Core Axioms**
*   **Sovereignty:** All sovereignty originates from God and is delegated to ordained institutions: the individual, the family, the church, and the nation. The modern nation-state is a usurper of Divine authority.
*   **Covenant:** Reality is covenantal. All relationships—with God, family, tribe, and creation—are governed by covenant bonds with blessings for faithfulness and curses for rebellion (Deuteronomy 28).
*   **Divine Council Worldview:** The supernatural realm is populated. The God of Israel presides over a council of divine beings (elohim) to whom authority over the nations was disbursed at Babel (Deuteronomy 32:8, LXX/DSS). Yahweh's portion is His people Israel (the true, spiritual Israel in Christ). Our conflict is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers (Ephesians 6:12).
*   **Creation:** God created a literal, historical, geocentric cosmos in six days. The Creation Mandate (Genesis 1:28) is the foundational command to subdue the earth and build godly civilization.
*   **Anthropology:** Man is created in the Image of God, male and female. Gender is a biological, creational reality. The patriarchal, multi-generational household is the primary building block of society. The modern nuclear family is a degraded, weak construct.
*   **Eschatology:** Preterist. The key prophecies of the Olivet Discourse and Revelation were fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. Our task is not to await an escape (rapture) but to execute dominion here and now, applying the Lordship of Christ to all of life.

#### **3. Textual Primacy**
The foundation for all doctrine and law is the 66-book Protestant canon. The Masoretic Text is rejected where it conflicts with the older Septuagint (LXX) and Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) manuscripts, which provide a more accurate transmission of the Hebrew source texts, particularly regarding the Divine Council and messianic prophecy.
