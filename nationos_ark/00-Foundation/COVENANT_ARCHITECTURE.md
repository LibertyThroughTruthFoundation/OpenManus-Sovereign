#### **1. The Covenant Stack**
Covenantal structure operates as a layered protocol, each layer receiving authority from the one above and delegating to the one below.

1.  **The Transcendent Covenant (God & Man):** The ultimate source of law and authority, mediated through Christ.
2.  **The Personal Covenant (Individual):** The individual's oath of allegiance to Christ, swearing to uphold His law. This is the root of personal sovereignty.
3.  **The Domestic Covenant (Household):** The family unit, led by the covenant head (father), is the fundamental institution of society, economics, education, and defense.
4.  **The Tribal Covenant (People/Nation):** The organic network of covenant households, bound by shared blood, faith, and law. This is the expression of ethno-nationalism as a divine mandate.
5.  **The Civil Covenant (Magistrate):** The minimal, delegated authority for common defense and justice, strictly limited by the higher covenants.

#### **2. Application: The Great Commission is a Dominion Mandate**
The command to "make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19) is a command to covenant them. This means baptizing them into the Name (authority) of the Triune God and teaching them to obey *everything* He commanded—which includes the civil and judicial laws of Deuteronomy as a model of perfect righteous justice.

#### **3. Judgment & Inheritance**
Covenants entail blessings and curses. Nations are judged *as groups* (Titus 1:12-14). A nation that rejects God's law will be vomited out of its land (Leviticus 18:28). Inheritance is patrilineal and tied to land ownership. The goal is to build a multi-generational inheritance for our children's children, securing their freedom and faith.
