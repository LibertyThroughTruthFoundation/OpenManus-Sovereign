#### **1. The Babel Dispersion (The Origin of Nations)**
At Babel, God judged the unified rebellion of mankind by confounding language and, according to the LXX/DSS reading of Deuteronomy 32:8-9, "He set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the angels of God." Each nation (ethnos) was placed under the authority of a lesser elohim (divine being), while Yahweh Himself took Israel as His direct portion.

#### **2. The Psalm 82 Judgment**
These ruling elohim failed to administer justice. Psalm 82 depicts the Divine Council scene where God passes judgment on these "gods," condemning them for ruling unjustly and showing partiality to the wicked. Their sentence: "You are gods...nevertheless, you shall die like men" (Psalm 82:6-7). This signifies the stripping of their authority and the eventual victory of Yahweh's Kingdom over all rival principalities.

#### **3. The Christological Conquest**
Christ's work was not merely individual salvation but a cosmic conquest. His death and resurrection disarmed the principalities and powers (Colossians 2:15). He has been given all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18), reclaiming the nations from the rebellious elohim. We are now engaged in mopping-up operations, applying the victory of Christ to every sphere of life until every rival throne is subordinated to His.

#### **4. Modern Implications**
*   **Nationalism:** Ethno-nationalism is a creational and spiritual reality. A people is an extended household under a shared divine mandate.
*   **The Spiritual War:** The "Great Replacement" and other anti-national agendas are not merely political but are spiritual warfare, manifestations of principality-level attacks on the covenant people.
*   **The True Israel:** The modern state of Israel has no special theological status. It is a secular nation like any other. The true, spiritual Israel is the body of Christ, the international people of God from every tribe and tongue, who are the heirs of the promises.
