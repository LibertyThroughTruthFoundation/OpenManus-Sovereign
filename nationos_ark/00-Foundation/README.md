# NationOS Ark: Foundation Documents

**Directory:** `00-Foundation`
**Status:** Canonical
**Purpose:** Immutable Theological Brainstem

---

## Overview

This directory contains the **foundational theological documents** that serve as the immutable brainstem of the entire NationOS project. These documents establish the theological, covenantal, and spiritual framework from which all technical specifications, protocols, and modules are derived.

## Core Documents

### 1. THEOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORK.md
**The Doctrinal Foundation**

This document establishes the core theological axioms that govern the entire project:
- Rejection of syncretism
- Sovereignty, Covenant, and Divine Council Worldview
- Creation, Anthropology, and Eschatology
- Textual primacy (LXX/DSS-informed readings)

### 2. COVENANT_ARCHITECTURE.md
**The Structural Blueprint**

This document translates theological principles into a layered covenant protocol:
- The Covenant Stack (5 layers from Transcendent to Civil)
- The Great Commission as Dominion Mandate
- Judgment, Inheritance, and Multi-generational Building

### 3. DIVINE_COUNCIL_WORLDVIEW.md
**The Spiritual Battlefield**

This document provides the supernatural lens for understanding current events and spiritual warfare:
- The Babel Dispersion and origin of nations
- The Psalm 82 Judgment on rebellious elohim
- The Christological Conquest and modern implications
- Ethno-nationalism as a creational reality
